(1);
analyze the implication of charging the battery fully first when there is too much renewables and exporting
power to the grind thereafter
                        OVER 
allowing MPC to determine the best course of action based on the available data
AIM --> to test the hypothesis that battery should always be charged first

(2);
Repeat 1 with CO2 reduction consideration. Not economical gains only.
CO2 savings

(3);
Influence of initial SOC in the performance of microgrid

(4);
Flactuating CO2 charges daily and seasonally based on the grid composition

(5);
Fixed electricity price for one case and compared it when are varying to show
how controls are changed/set to optimiza economic cost

(6);
Acount for curtailment in the model

(7);
Analysis of the impact of grid, how does it affect initial investment and operational one.
What is the economic/environmental gain of using grid? ---> (+Spero)

(8);
Components sizes comparison when grid is considered and whwn there is no grid

(9);
Analyze the effect of importing only from grid and not exporting

(10);
Analyze storage cost in terms of kWh batterys cost vs kWh H2 storage 

(11);
When carbon adherence is done in different time scale, whar happens to the system sizing, cost etc?

(12);
Could register(circular, etc) operation be used to save memory when implementing receding princeiple?

(13);
Plot of CO2 savings on various cases

(14);
What will happen when simulation is runned with different initial storage level? OR when
the level at the end of the day is assured at a particular value?
